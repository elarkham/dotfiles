Once upon a time there were three little piglets.
Their mother had decided that they would have to set off
on their own and so the three piglets were now apart. 
Also a wolf was there and so on.
So two piglets were eaten because they were lazy pieces of ...dirt.
And then the last pig ate the wolf. 
The last piglet lived a good life the end.
